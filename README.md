## Create React using Vite and Create-React-ApP

### Best Practice

1. Component(function) we need to use capitalize.
2. Component file name use capitalize.
3. Some library force to use jsx if we are import the component in the jsx file.
4. Use fragement <> </> to return multiple tags.
5. Use .jsx as extension if we are returning html

### React

1. Single Page Application
2. React, create a tree structure and inject in the DOM.
3. Evaluated expression can be use to return variable in the JSX function {}
4. Babel is the tool that converts JSX into React.createElement() calls behind the scenes. JSX is not valid JavaScript on its own, so Babel acts as a transpiler that transforms JSX into something browsers can understand.
5. React hooks use for updating the DOM element for instance counter value, need to update at multiple spots at that time we have to use hooks otherwise in plain js we have to get the id, set the text content all over the code.
6. ReactDOM.createRoot() create react DOM structure, compare browser DOM and created react DOM structure and only replace the changes instead of reloading.
7. Reconcilation: The algorithm React uses to diff one tree (Browser DOM) with another(React DOM) to determine which parts need to be changed.
8. In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately; in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.
9. Different types of updates have different priorities â€” an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, say, an update from a data store.
10. A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.
11. React-fiber primary goal is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling, we need to able to
    - Pause work and come back later
    - Assign priority to work
    - Reuse previously completed work
    - Abort work if no longer needed
12. useState
13. useEffect
14. useRef
15. useCallback
16. useId : useId is a React Hook for generating unique IDs that can be passed to accessibility attributes.
17. Use starting as capital letter for the component
18. Rememeber to use the key in the React loops for performance
19. For multiple components best practise is to create index.js and import it all the components in the js file and use js file in the jsx file to get the components
20. React-Router-Dom: a tag vs link - a tag use to navigate to another source page and reload the DOM, which in turn rewriting DOM structure where as the link avoid reloading of the screen
21. Nav-link: <NavLink> is a wrapper around <Link> that automatically applies styles or classes when the link matches the current URL.<NavLink> in React Router is a powerful component for building navigation menus that highlight the active route.
22. Router-dom Outlet: properties use for rendering dynamic page in the react, for instance Home , footer remain static but between the Header and Footer component we have outlet, that is dynamic
23. Router-dom createBrowserRouter is use to create router, method takes an array.
