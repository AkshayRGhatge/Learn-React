## Create React using Vite and Create-React-ApP

### Best Practice

1. Component(function) we need to use capitalize.
2. Component file name use capitalize.
3. Some library force to use jsx if we are import the component in the jsx file.
4. Use fragement <> </> to return multiple tags.
5. Use .jsx as extension if we are returning html

### React

1. Single Page Application
2. React, create a tree structure and inject in the DOM.
3. Evaluated expression can be use to return variable in the JSX function {}
4. Babel is the tool that converts JSX into React.createElement() calls behind the scenes. JSX is not valid JavaScript on its own, so Babel acts as a transpiler that transforms JSX into something browsers can understand.
